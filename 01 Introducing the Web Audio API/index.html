<h2>Introducing the Web Audio API</h2>

'hello world' application presented as a code example, showing perhaps the simplest use of the Web Audio API to produce and manipulate sound.

We then extend this application to show alternative approaches to its implementation, coding practices, and how sound is manipulated in an audio graph. 

<ol>
   <li><a href="stereoPanning.html">Listener</a>: a simple use of the StereoPannerNode, showing a minimal implementation.
   <li><a href="Stereo Enhancer/stereoEnhancer.html">Stereo enhancer</a>: a stereo enhancer or stereo widener effect, which takes a stereo input stream and re-represents it as mid and side rather than left and right components. The relative strength of these components can be varied to narrow or widen the audio stream's use of the stereo field.
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 1 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
