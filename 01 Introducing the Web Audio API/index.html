<h2>Introducing the Web Audio API</h2>

'hello world' application presented as a code example, showing perhaps the simplest use of the Web Audio API to produce and manipulate sound.

We then extend this application to show alternative approaches to its implementation, coding practices, and how sound is manipulated in an audio graph.

   <li><a href="HelloWorld/HelloWorld.html">Hello World</a>: possibly the simplest example of using the Web Audio API to make a sound
   <li><a href="UserInteraction/UserInteraction.html">UserInteraction</a>: extending the Hello World with a gain control
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 1 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
