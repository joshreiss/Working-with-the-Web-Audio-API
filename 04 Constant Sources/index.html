<h2>Constant sources</h2>

The ConstantSourceNode represents an audio source whose output is a constant value. Examples are provided showing;

<ol>
  <li><a href="DCoffset.html">DCoffset: applying a DC offset to an oscillator, which also demonstrates what happens when rendering audio outside the range -1 to +1
  <li><a href="ConstantSourceSquareWave/ConstantSourceSquareWave.html">ConstantSourceSquareWave: use of a constant source node to construct a square wave
  <li><a href="Grouping tracks/Grouping.html">Grouping tracks: grouping tracks in a multitrack audio, and applying the same processing on all tracks in a groupwhen working with multitrack audio.
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 04 of the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
