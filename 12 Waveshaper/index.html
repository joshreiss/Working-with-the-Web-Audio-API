<h2>Waveshaper</h2>

- Clipper: This simply clips an audio signal so that all output samples are in the range -1 to +1
- BitCrusher: This quantises samples to be represented with 2^N levels, where N is some number of bits. It reduces the perceived bit depth in a signal.

Two code examples are provided.

<ol>
   <li><a href="stereoPanning.html">Listener</a>: a simple use of the StereoPannerNode, showing a minimal implementation.
   <li><a href="Stereo Enhancer/stereoEnhancer.html">Stereo enhancer</a>: a stereo enhancer or stereo widener effect, which takes a stereo input stream and re-represents it as mid and side rather than left and right components. The relative strength of these components can be varied to narrow or widen the audio stream's use of the stereo field.
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 12 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
