<h2>Filters</h2>

These examples cover design, use and visualisation of filters in the Web Audio API. They focus on two audio nodes, the BiquadFilterNode and IIRFilterNode.

<ol>
  <li><a href="BiquadFilterNode/biquad.html">BiquadFilterNode</a>: Visualises all the filter types for the BiquadFilterNode, as well as how changing filter parameters affects the filter's magnitude response.
  <li><a href="IIRFilterNode/IIRFilter.html">IIRFilterNode</a>: Visualise and listen to audio with a third order lowpass filter applied.
  <li>Instability: contains two examples showing how IIR filters can go unstable, and in unusual conditions, the biquad filter can become unstable.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Instability/IIRInstability.html">IIRInstability</a>: a simple first order filter that goes unstable as the feedback term is increased (pole moves outside the unit circle)
      <li><a href="Instability/BiquadInstability.html">BiquadInstability</a>: showing how changing filter parameters very, very rapidly can lead to instability in a BiquadFilterDesign
  </ul>   
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 11 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
