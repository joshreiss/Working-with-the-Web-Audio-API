<h2>Dynamic Range Compression</h2>

These examples illustrate use of the DynamicsCompressorNode

Two code examples are provided.

<ol>
   <li><a href="Attack and release/AttackRelease.html">Attack and release</a>: shows how to visualize the effect of varying the ballistics, that is, the compressor's attack and release parameters.
   <li><a href="Compressor/compressor.html">Compressor</a>: shows a compressor in action. It displays a meter of the gain reduction while a user changes the parameters of a compressor that is applied to a source.
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 13 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
