<h2>The Wonders of Audio Worklets</h2>

Here, we revisit previous examples, and show how they can be achieved using audio worklets instead.

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 19 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.

- PulseWave: shows how pulse waves and square waves may be created without use of a Fourier series,
- Bit crusher worklet: s bit crusher designed without storing a wave shaping curve
- CompressorWorklet: a dynamic range compressor be implemented with very fast response
- StereoWidenerWorklet: a stereo enhancer that preserves signal power.
- KarplusStrong: the Karplus-Strong algorithm implemented without the limitations on the pitch range that come from the DelayNode in a feedback loop.
