<h2>OfflineAudioContext</h2>

The OfflineAudioContext renders an audio graph to a buffer as fast as it can.

We provide three examples of using the OfflineAudioContext;

<ol>
   <li><a href="OfflineContext.html">OfflineContext</a>: rendering to a buffer much faster than real-time
   <li><a href="OfflineContext2.html">OfflineContext2</a>: recording the output of an offline audio graph without needing an additional online audio context, and
   <li><a href="OfflineContext3.html">OfflineContext3</a>: providing a progress bar for rendering by suspending and resuming the offline context. This last example is especially useful for highly computational tasks where processing is much slower than real-time.
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 09 the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
