<h2>Reverb</h2>

These examples show use of the ConvolverNode to implement convolutional reverb.

Two code examples are provided.

<ol>
   <li><a href="ConvolutionReverb.html">ConvolutionReverb</a>: illustrates typical use of the convolver node, where a source is convolved with a simulated impulse response
   <li><a href="NormalizeIR/NormalizeIR.html">NormalizeIR</a>: illustrates a minor issue with use of the ConvolverNode's normalize parameter. In this example, the impulse responses are stored in wav files
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 14 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
