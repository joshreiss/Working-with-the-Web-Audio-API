<h2>Delay</h2>

Here, we look at the DelayNode in the Web Audio API. We give four examples;

<ol>
   <li><a href="combFilter.html">Comb filter</a>: simple summing of a source and a delayed copy to produce comb filtering
   <li><a href="Vibrato/vibrato.html">Vibrato</a>: implementation of a Vibrato effect, by modulating a delay line with a low frequency oscillator
   <li><a href="feedbackDelay.html">Feedback delay</a>: implementation of a Vibrato effect, by modulating a delay line with a low frequency oscillator
   <li><a href="KarplusStrong/KarplusStrong.html">Karplus-Strong</a>: the Karplus-Strong algorithm for producing the sound of a plucked string. 
      This also demonstrates a limitation of the DelayNode when used in a feedback loop.
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 10 the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
