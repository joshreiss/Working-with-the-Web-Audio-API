<h2>Connecting audio parameters and modulation</h2>

Here, we look at how an audio nodeâ€™s output can be connected to a parameter of another node. There are two examples.

<ul>
  <li><a href="FM Synthesis/FMSynthesis.html">FMSynthesis</a>: shows how FM synthesis is performed by connecting a Low Frequency Oscillator to the frequency parameter of another oscillator.
  <li><a href="AM Synthesis/AMSynthesis.html">AMSynthesis</a>: for implementing AM synthesis by connecting a Low Frequency Oscillator to the gain parameter of a gain node.
</ul>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 06 of the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
