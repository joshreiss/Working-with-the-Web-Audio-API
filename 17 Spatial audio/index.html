<h2>Spatial audio</h2>

Spatial audio involves placing sound sources anywhere in the three dimensional space around the listener. Here we have two code examples;

<ol>
   <li><a href="listener/listener.html">Listener</a>: moving alistener around a source in two dimensions
   <li><a href="pannerNode/panner.html">pannerNode</a>: moving a source in the 3D space around a listener.
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 17 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
