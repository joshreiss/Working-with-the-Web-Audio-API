<h2>Mixing audio</h2>

These code examples illustrate use of the ChannelMergerNode and ChannelSplitterNode, as well as how to perform connections to/from nodes with multiple inputs/outputs.

Two code examples are provided.

<ol>
   <li><a href="ChannelFlip.html">ChannelFlip</a>: shows how to flip the channels in a stereo audio stream
   <li><a href="PingPongDelay.html">PingPongDelay</a>: shows how a delay effect can 'bounce' delayed copies of a signal between left and right channels of an output audio stream. ChannelMerger is used to combine audio streams into stereo output.
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 15 in the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
