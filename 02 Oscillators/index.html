<h2>Oscillators</h2>

This Chapter focuses on OscillatorNodes.

<ol>
   <li><a href="OscillatorNode/Oscillator.html">OscillatorNode</a> demonstrates use of the built-in oscillator types and varying the oscillator's frequency
   <li><a href="Detuning/detune.html">Detuning</a> shows use of detuning the pitch and how it relates to musical notation.
   <li>There are two examples of creating custom oscillators using the PeriodicWave.
   </li>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="PeriodicWave/CustomSquareWave.html">Creating a square wave</a>: implementation of a Vibrato effect, by modulating a delay line with a low frequency oscillator
      <li><a href="PeriodicWave/PulseWave.html">Creating a pulse wave</a>, which is like a square wave but with a duty cycle parameter which controls how much of its period it spends near its peak value.
   </ul>
</ol>

Code examples correspond to examples from Chapter 02 the book 'Working with the Web Audio API'.
